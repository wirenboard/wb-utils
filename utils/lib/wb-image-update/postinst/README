Wiren Board image update postinst scripts
=========================================

Scripts from this directory are called in FIT image installation process
after rootfs is extracted and device certificates are recovered.

Scripts from NEW rootfs are used.

Scripts are called NOT from this rootfs environment. They may be even
called from Busybox minimal environment (initramfs in FIT images).
If you need some tools from rootfs, use chroot.
/dev, /proc and /sys are already mounted to rootfs here.

Scripts are called in alphabetic order; you can use it by adding numeric
prefixes to script names (e.g. 99-install-uboot.sh).

Invokation of these scripts is performed in install_image.sh script
(see https://github.com/wirenboard/wirenboard repo for more details).

See 10update-u-boot script as an example.
